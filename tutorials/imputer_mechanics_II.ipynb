    "In the code samples above, we introduce the concept of a **series-imputer**. Remember that the `strategy` for each column in a `SingleImputer` is simply a key that maps to a series-imputer class prefixed by the strategy's name. Also recall that the `SingleImputer` delegates work to the series-imputer that corresponds to a specified strategy. The series-imputer then implements the algorithm on behalf of the `SingleImputer` and returns the results."

As a result, the `si_interp` `Imputer` delegates the work for `salary` to the `InterpolateImputer`, with `fill_strategy` set to `linear`. Similarly, the `si_interp` `Imputer` delegates the work for `weight` to another `InterpolateImputer`, wich uses `quadratic` instead of `linear` for its `fill_strategy`. Each column gets a **separate instance** of the `InterpolateImputer`, which does the imputation work for column it's supposed to impute.

    "This **design pattern** is inherently robust and flexible. The `SingleImputer` focuses on all the class setup, error handling, and dirty work to make the `Imputer` easy, familiar, and flexible. It then prepares the data for all strategy-specific series-imputers to handle. But in the end, the `SingleImputer` delegates all the imputation work and simply waits for the results of each strategy-specific series-imputer to do its job. This makes it easy to identify a bug should something break down during imputation because we've isolated responsibilities and independently delegated work for each column's imputation."
