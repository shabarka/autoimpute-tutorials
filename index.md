### Welcome to the tutorials page for the Autoimpute package!

This page contains multiple tutorials that introduce users to Autoimpute and explore the package's features & capabilities. To get started, review the following tutorials:  

* [Exploring Missingness Patterns](exploring-missingness.html)  
* [Getting the Most out of the Imputer Classes: Part I](imputer-mechanics-I.html)
* [Getting the Most out of the Imputer Classes: Part II](imputer-mechanics-II.html)  
* [Comparing Imputation Methods](comparing-imputation-methods.html)   


We plan to add more tutorials soon to walk users through more advanced usage of the Autoimpute package. In the meantime, please contact us if you have any questions. Our information can be found [in the Autoimpute package repo](https://github.com/kearnz/autoimpute/blob/master/AUTHORS.rst).
