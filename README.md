# AutoImpute Tutorials
Welcome to the tutorials repository for the AutoImpute package!

This repo contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks that introduce users to the autoimpute and explore the package's features and capabilities. To get started, review the following tutorials:
    * [Exploring Missingness Patterns](https://github.com/kearnz/autoimpute-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/exploring_missingness.ipynb)
    * [Comparing Imputation Methods](https://github.com/kearnz/autoimpute-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/comparing_imputation_methods.ipynb)

We plan to add more tutorials soon to walk users through more advanced usage of the autoimpute package. In the meantime, please contact us if you have any questions. Our information can be found [in the autoimpute package](https://github.com/kearnz/autoimpute/blob/master/AUTHORS.rst).
